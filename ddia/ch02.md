### Chapter 2. Data Models and Query Language

#### 2.1 Relational Model Versus Document Model



##### The Birth of NoSQL



##### The Object-Relation Mismatch



##### Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships

Anything that is meaningful to humans may need to change sometime in the future, and if that information is duplicated, all the redundant  copies need to be updated. That icurs write overheads, and risks inconsistencies. Removing such duplications is the key idea behind *nomarlization* in databases.



Many-to-one relationships don't fit into the document model.



##### Are Document Database Repeating History?

###### The network model

- a record could have multiple parents.
- links between records like pointers in a programming language.
- the only way of accessing a record is to follow a path from a root record, called access path
- access path 难以维护



###### The relational model



###### Comparison to document databases



##### Relation Versus Document Databases Today

relationships vs schema

It depends on the relationships that exist between data items to say which data model leads to simpler application code.



###### Schema flexibility in the document model

schemaless -> schema-on-read



###### Data locality for queries



###### Convergence of document and realional databases
