### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable

#### Thinking About Data Systems



#### Reliability

- performs the function as expected.
- can tolerate mistakes, or using in unexpected ways.
- good enough performance.
- prvents unauthorized access and abuse.

continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong.



It only makes sense to talk about tolerating *certain types* of faults



It is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures.



faults with no cure, such as security matters.



##### Hardware Errors

- redundancy of hardware components.
- systems that can tolerate the loss of entire machines, by using software fault-tolerance techniques in addition to hardware redundancy.



##### Softwre Errors



##### Human Errors

- design system in a way that minimizes opportunities fo error.
- decouples the places where people make the most mistakes from the places where they can cause failures.
- test thoroghly at all levels.
- allow quick and easy recovery from human errors.
- setup detailed and clear monitoring.
- implement good managerment practices and training.



##### How Important Is Reliability
